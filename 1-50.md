**1** **Introduction**

**1.1** **Overview**

This document defines the logical and physical data that must be
transferred between PMNs under the Transferred Account Procedure (TAP).
It additionally contains all the validation rules that can be applied to
a TAP3 file.

The version of TAP supported by this document is Specification Version
Number 3, Release Version Number 12. The implementation timetable for
this version of TAP is such that all TAP files created on or after 01
May 2013 must conform to this standard (see TD.34 for further
information on implementation of new TAP standards).

The transfer mechanism for TAP files is discussed in TD.28.

The primary commercial requirement for data to be transferred is defined
in permanent reference document BA.12.

Note: Because there are many standards and documents relating to the
Transferred Account Procedure, terminology can become confused, not
least because each standard may have its own term for any particular
item of data. For the purposes of this document BA.12 is considered the
prime input document in terms of the commercial requirement and items
are named accordingly.

The other major input documents are the 3GPP specifications listed in
Annex C.

**1.1.1** **About** **This** **Document**

The document is divided into several sections, the purpose of each being
as follows.

Section 1: Introduction

> • It places the document in context and explains the purpose of each
> section of the document.

Section 2: Differences from the Commercial Requirement

> • This section identifies the differences between the original
> commercial requirement and the implementation delivered.

Section 3: Logical Structure

> • The section contains diagrams of the logical structure of the TAP
> interface.

Section 4: Data Dictionary

> • The Data Dictionary identifies each item and describes it in detail.
> Included are rules on optionality, conditionality and validation
> (including error codes). The item derivations are also included.

Section 5: Classification of Errors

>
> • Gives further information regarding the error severity levels. Also
> gives details of other general validation check, for example
> duplicates.
>
> Section 6: Physical Format
>
> • This section gives the encoding rules and physical definition of the
> TAP file.
>
> Annex A: Supplementary Services
>
> • The section details the supplementary service events which may be
> present on the TAP interface and the context in which they should be
> delivered.
>
> Annex B: Changes from Previous Specification Version Number
>
> • This section highlights the requirements for changes made, the
> originator of that requirement and the Release Version when it is
> supported.
>
> Annex C: Description for 3GPP Releases and Specifications
>
> • This section defines the different standards specifications
> applicable to every GSM/3GPP release.
>
> **1.2** **Scope**
>
> This Permanent Reference Document defines, in full, the format and
> validation of TAP files that can be used on the public interface.
> Usage of additional documents to define the format and validation of
> TAP is limited to the explicit references included within sections 4,
> 5 and 6 of this document.
>
> **1.2.1** **Purpose**
>
> This document is intended for use when implementing the exchange,
> validation or viewing of TAP files. This document is technical in
> nature and requires knowledge of data design and ASN.1 principles.

**2.5** **Reference** **Tables**

In order to minimise the amount of data transferred and to avoid the
repetition of frequently identical information at the call/event level a
series of reference tables have been incorporated:

> • Message Description Information; each table row comprises a code
> with its description.
>
> • Taxation; each table row comprises a code with its tax type and
> rate.
>
> • Discounting; each table row comprises a code with its discount
> applied, either the fixed discount amount or a discount rate.
>
> • Currency Conversion; each table row comprises a code with its
> exchange rate and an indication of how many decimal places are
> represented.
>
> • UTC Time Offset Information; each table row comprises a code with
> its offset value. • Recording Entity Information; each table row
> comprises a code with its entity type,
>
> for example MSC, and entity identifier.

The codes are used within the calls/events as required.

**2.6** **Supplementary** **Services**

Unlike 3GPP TS 32.005, GSM Association PRD BA.12 has no concept of
events. BA.12 assumes that supplementary services, when not used in
conjunction with a call action, for example activation, are treated in a
similar manner to mobile originated calls. There will be no called party
but some supplementary services have additional information which may be
useful for example the number involved in call forward activation.

These non call related Supplementary Services are treated as separate
events within the TAP.

**2.7** **Location** **Information**

The Location Area Code (LAC), Cell Identity and SGSN Address are
maintained in TAP for all applicable services for technical and
operational reasons.

**2.8** **Dates** **and** **Times**

All date/time items cater for millennium compliance and have the format
CCYYMMDDHHMMSS.

All timestamps are provided in the sending PMN’s local time further
qualified by an offset from Universal Time (UTC). This enables the HPMN
to easily calculate its (HPMN) local time, especially useful when
computing charges for forwarding calls to roamed subscribers.

**2.9** **File** **Size** **Limitations**

Due to the high system resource consumption of tools used for ASN.1
processing, as used for TAP3, a file size limit has been set (see
‘Validation Rules Not Described In Data Dictionary’).

**2.10** **Support** **for** **Interstandard** **Number**
**Portability**

Inclusion of elements ESN (Electronic Serial Number), MIN (Mobile
Identification Number) and MDN (Mobile Directory Number) are required to
support mobile number portability within markets supporting various
technology standards, for example USA.

**2.11** **Exchange** **Rate** **for** **Non** **IMF** **Currencies**

A tolerance of two units on the 5th significant digit of the calculated
Exchange Rate for non IMF currencies and currencies which have been
derived from a fixed exchange rate against another currency is required
to avoid operational problems when validating the Exchange Rate on
different systems.

Note: This is needed due to inaccurate values of exchange rates commonly
used in the industry.

**2.12** **Exchange** **Rate** **for** **IMF** **Currencies**

The IMF has increased the number of digits used to post an exchange
rate, which could now be represented with more than 5 significant
digits. This could have a major impact on some operator systems and a
tolerance has therefore been introduced to allow operators who cannot
support the full number of significant digits listed by the IMF to round
either up or down from the more accurate IMF exchange rate.

Note: This is needed as not all operators are able to support more than
5 significant digits. Operators who can support all digits as published
by IMF must, of course, not round the exchange rate in TAP and must
populate TAP with the full IMF published exchange rate.

**2.13** **Exchange** **Rate** **higher** **than** **expected**

A validation rule has been added for operational reasons to enable TAP
files to be rejected when Exchange Rates are higher than expected.

**2.14** **Partial** **Type** **Indicator**

BA.12 states that this element is mandatory to populate where the TAP
record represents part of a context, whereas there is no validation rule
currently applied on Partial Type Indicator existence and validity in
TAP.

Practically, and due to implementation concerns, adding such validation
rules would create a number of operational issues, therefore such rules
are not defined.

**2.15** **TAP** **Versions** **Supported**

BA.12 states rules governing liabilities for conversion between TAP
versions. The implicit requirement is for no restrictions on the TAP
versions used.

Practically, this is technically no longer tenable and the technical
constraint is that the public interface will only support the latest two
versions. At the time of writing, November 2013, this means that the
current TAP version v3.12 and the preceeding one v3.11 are allowed on
the public interface. Use of any other TAP version must be bilaterally
agreed.

The BA.12 conversion requirements remain unaffected.

> **Figure** **1** **Conventions** **used** **within** **Logical**
> **Structure** **Diagrams**

In the following sections the logical structure is broken down
diagrammatically to show the logical record formats. Each item is
clarified to show whether it is:

> Mandatory Conditional
>
> Optional

Must be present.

In general, must be present. However in certain circumstances the
element may not occur because the particular circumstance is not
relevant or the information is not available (for example from the
network).

Does not need to be present. Inclusion/exclusion of optional elements is
at the discretion of the Sender PMN, no specific agreements need to be
in place to allow the PMN to include these elements.

> Repeating Occurs more than once for a given situation (may also be
> conditional or optional).

The rules for conditionality and optionality are given in the data
dictionary.

Where items are repeating items this is also documented. Again, fuller
descriptions are given in the data dictionary.

If an item is conditional and does not exist due to conditionality rules
then, obviously, those items below it in the hierarchy cannot exist
either, even if denoted as mandatory. However, if it does exist then any
mandatory item directly below it in the hierarchy must also exist.

Note that the notation does not imply any particular “level” of data
within the structure by virtue of its position within the diagram. The
only “levels” which exist are the hierarchic levels denoted by the box
which contains the data item name.
